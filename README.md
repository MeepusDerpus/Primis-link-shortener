# Diary Thoughts

This was a pretty interesting exercise\
I'd say I approached it as an actual production project rather than a POC exercise\
Hence I felt there was a lot of  where I tried to fill in the gaps from my current work:
- Existing Architecture (Vendors, Microservices, EDA, monolith etc)
- Business/Product constraints, requirements. 
- DevOps integration (CICD, DBs, Cloud Platforms)
- I'd like to be a lot more thorough in testing (unit tests, integration tests, load tests) but time constraints are tight
